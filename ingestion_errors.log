  "content": "Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nEuropean Union (EU) countries have endorsed sweeping tariff cuts for American farm and manufactured products, adopting negotiating mandates that move the bloc closer to eliminating all remaining duties on U.S. industrial goods and opening new preferential access for a broad range of American agricultural exports.\n\nEuropean Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on July 16, 2025. Yves Herman /Reuters\n\nThe decision by the European Council, announced on Nov. 28, clears the way for talks with the European Parliament on two regulations that implement the tariff elements of the Aug. 21 EU–U.S. Joint Statement—an accord that aims to stabilize transatlantic trade ties, reduce tensions, and rebalance two-way commerce amid lingering disputes over metals, tariffs, and digital-sector rules.\n\nThe first regulation would zero out the EU’s remaining customs duties on U.S. industrial goods and establish new tariff-rate quotas and reduced tariffs for U.S. seafood and non-sensitive agricultural products, including a host of items identified in the joint statement—tree nuts, dairy, fruits and vegetables, processed foods, soybean oil, pork, bison meat, and planting seeds.\n\nThe second regulation would extend the bloc’s five-year duty suspension on live and frozen lobster past the July 2025 expiration date—and widen the scope to include processed lobster.\n\nEU officials described the package as a major step toward restoring “stability and predictability” to the EU–U.S. trade relationship that accounts for 30 percent of global trade and roughly $2 trillion in goods and services annually, with mutual investment totaling $5.4 trillion in 2023.\n\nThe European Council’s Friday decision to endorse the two regulations comes in response to a late-August proposal by the European Commission to slash tariffs on U.S. industrial goods and extend preferential access for American seafood and non-sensitive agricultural products as required under the Aug. 21 trade deal.\n\nStronger Safeguards for Sensitive EU Sectors\n\nWhile largely backing the European Commission’s proposal, EU governments added new protections for vulnerable domestic producers. The Council inserted a strengthened bilateral safeguard mechanism allowing the EU to respond quickly to import surges or evidence of injury caused by the expanded market access granted to U.S. exporters.\n\nIt also clarified rules-of-origin provisions to ease implementation and called on the commission to monitor the economic effects of the trade liberalization measures, with a report due by the end of 2028.\n\nThe lobster regulation passed without changes.\n\nWith the mandates now adopted, the EU will enter trilogue negotiations with the European Parliament, aiming for a final deal possibly early next year, reflecting Washington’s push for swift implementation of the August pact after months of friction over digital rules, metals tariffs, and a series of threatened U.S. duties on trucks, critical minerals, planes, and wind turbines.\n\nThe tariff moves are part of a broader realignment mapped out in the August agreement, a document officials on both sides have described as the most ambitious reset in EU–U.S. trade ties in two decades. Under the deal, the EU committed to eliminating all tariffs on U.S. industrial goods, expanding agricultural and seafood access, and extending the 2020 lobster agreement—while the United States set a 15 percent ceiling on most tariffs applied to EU goods.\n\nWashington also agreed to roll back “Section 232” duties on EU autos and parts once the EU introduced its legislative proposals; reduce tariff exposure for items such as aircraft, cork, and generic pharmaceuticals; and limit Section 232 tariffs on sectors including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber.\n\nThe U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum—set at 50 percent—remain unchanged, though both sides have pledged to explore joint solutions to global steel overcapacity, including possible tariff-rate quotas.\n\nThe framework also extends beyond tariffs, covering digital trade, non-tariff barriers, energy supply, critical minerals, defense procurement, and standards cooperation. The EU has committed to purchase $750 billion in U.S. natural gas, oil, and nuclear products through 2028, plus at least $40 billion in U.S.-made AI chips for European computing centers. EU companies also plan to invest another $600 billion in the United States through 2028.\n\nWant to know more?\nEU And Whose Army?\n'Massive Shift' In US-Korea Relations After Trump Gets Seoul To Stop Targeting Tech\nNEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST\nZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX\n\nReceive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.\n\nSHOW COMMENTS"

  "content": "Authored by Andrew Corbley via AntiWar.com,\n\nA Ukrainian MP recently made an unsubstantiated claim that there were 400,000 open and ongoing cases of desertion from the Ukrainian military since the invasion by the Russian Federation in 2022. It may have been hyperbole, or they may have had a source in the judiciary.\n\nHowever, the General Prosecutor’s office wrote to the New Voice of Ukraine in early November that 310,000 criminal cases related to unauthorized absence from a military unit or place of service (AWOL) and desertion are currently registered, 162,000 of which came just this year. There have been over 21,000 desertions in October 2025 alone, claims journalist and former lawmaker Ihor Lutsenko – now commander of a Ukrainian drone unit.\n\n\"This is a record. A very bad record. Every two minutes, someone runs away from our army. By the time you finish reading this post, another soldier will have put on skis. Ukraine will be weaker by one defender, and the enemy will become stronger by one,\" he wrote, according to the New Voice. He stressed that these are just official figures, and that the real number is only likely to be higher.\n\nFile image, via War on the Rocks\n\nSuddenly, the widely dismissed total of 400,000 doesn’t seem impossible, and if a Ukrainian soldier downs his tools every 2 minutes, it leaves quite a lot of time for 400,000 to be reached by the end of the year.\n\nThe news comes as a 28-point plan for a lasting peace (later condensed to 19 points) in Ukraine was recently proposed by the Trump Administration in an effort to capitalize on talks with Vladimir Putin held during a summit in Alaska, and to bring the Ukrainians back to the table. Both Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have admitted that within the proposed plan points lies the framework discussed between the leaders in Anchorage without actually endorsing it. Both also acknowledged the \"long pause\" between the summit and the completion of this new document.\n\nOn the other hand, Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev told Axios, that published a full version of the agreement last Thursday, that he was \"optimistic\" and that \"we feel the Russian position is really being heard\".\n\nMilitary analysts skeptical of the Ukrainian army’s ability to withstand Russia for much longer have said that Russia will never agree to the US plan; they apparently include existing deal-breakers, and new demands including that Russia and Ukraine must implement tolerance and anti-racism education programs towards other nations and ethnic groups. The plan would give Ukraine a security guarantee akin to NATO membership, while also barring through constitutional amendment an attempt by Ukraine to join NATO.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could visit Trump at the White House in the next few days \"to complete final steps and make a deal,\" according to Ukraine’s national security chief. Meanwhile, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was recently in talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi.\n\nOne of the initial 28 points states that the Ukrainian armed forces must be limited to 600,000 soldiers, and Axios claimed the current strength to be 800,000, citing official sources. Ukrainian war correspondent Yuri Butusov put the number of Ukrainian war dead at 70,000 at the end of 2024 based on public notifications to next of kin. Conflicts of a similar nature to this have produced a 1-3 wounded-killed ratio, so it’s reasonable to assume some 300,000 killed and wounded since the start of the war.\n\nIf a number greater than 310,000 and lower than 400,000 have already fled, and 300,000 have become casualties, the idea that Ukraine maintains an 800,000-man army beggar's belief.\n\nMORE GEOPOLITICAL STORIES ON ZEROHEDGE\nHow Tucker Carlson Put Arab Christians On America's Map\nPoland Announces Foreign Spy Plot Busted, Involved Photographing Secretive Facilities \nAntifa Mob Mobilizes Terror Campaign Against AfD Event\nNEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST\nZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX\n\nReceive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.\n\nSHOW COMMENTS"

  "content": "Amid persistent confrontationalist rhetoric and determination to prolong the West's proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday announced a new avenue of voluntary military service for 18- and 19-year olds with the goal of gradually bolstering both active duty and reserve strength. In a critical sweetener for would-be recruits who are wary of dying in Ukraine, those who enlist under the new program will only serve in the French mainland and French territories abroad.   \n\nMacron announced the new voluntary service plan for 18- and 19-year-olds at the the Varces military base in the French Alps (Thomas Padilla, Pool Photo)\n\n“A new national service is set to be gradually established, starting from next summer,” said Macron in a speech delivered at the Varces military base in the French Alps. Under the program, the 18- and 19-year-old volunteers will receive a month of training, followed by nine months of service in a unit. After that, they'll be assigned to a reserve unit with the idea that they'd start a civilian career or take the next step in their education. The scheme will go live next summer with an initial round of 3,000 young volunteers, ramping up to 10,000 by 2030 and 50,000 a year by 2035.  France hasn't drafted soldiers since 1996, and Macron says there's no intention to restart conscription. \n\nWhen discussing the new service scheme, Macron has also stressed that he isn't creating a conveyor belt that will carry French troops into Russia's Ukraine meat grinder. “We must, in any case, immediately dispel any confusion that we are going to send our young people to Ukraine,” Macron said earlier this week. “That’s not at all what this is about.”\n\nRecruits into the new program will be assured they'll serve only in mainland France and overseas territories, unlike these French troops in Afghanistan in 2008 \n\nThe move comes as French and other European leaders are claiming Russia may be on course to attack NATO countries in the not-too-distant future. “Unfortunately, Russia today, based on the information I have access to, is preparing for a confrontation with our countries by 2030,\" said French army Chief of Staff Fabien Mandon last week. \"It is organizing itself for this, it is preparing for this, and it is convinced that its existential enemy is NATO.” Similarly, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Tuesday wrote, \"Putin eyes the EU and NATO. Our intelligence services are issuing urgent warnings: at the very least, Russia is creating the option for itself to wage war against NATO by 2029.\" \n\n“It’s good, it’s a difficult path,” Retired Gen. Jean-Paul Paloméros, a former head of the French Air Force, told AP, referring to the fact that training and equipping the new troops would require higher spending and create new demands on existing resources. “But nevertheless I think it was needed somewhere to make sure that the young generations understand that freedom and peace are not taken for granted and it doesn’t come as a free lunch.”\n\nPresident Macron, pictured here in a 2018 visit to the French Caribbean island of Saint-Martin, says the new troops won't be sent to Ukraine (Reuters via BBC)\n\nThe French move is part of rising militarism across NATO's European member states. Poland has started its own voluntary service program, with a goal of training 100,000 service members a year starting in 2027. Earlier this month, we covered Germany's moves toward potentially reinstating military conscription, which the country abandoned in 2011. The initial steps center on mandatory questionnaires and medical exams that will feed a database detailing each young man's fitness, aptitude and willingness to serve. \n\nPromoting the new French avenue of military service, Macron stoked fears that Russia is keen on marching into Paris. “The day that you send a signal of weakness to Russia — which for 10 years has made a strategic choice to become an imperial power again, that’s to say advance wherever we are weak — well, it will continue to advance,” Macron told RTL last week. As is the standard for leaders of NATO countries, Macron's rhetoric is pure gaslighting, as NATO's own empire-building set the stage for the ongoing war in Ukraine.  \n\nMORE GEOPOLITICAL STORIES ON ZEROHEDGE\nHow Tucker Carlson Put Arab Christians On America's Map\nPoland Announces Foreign Spy Plot Busted, Involved Photographing Secretive Facilities \nAntifa Mob Mobilizes Terror Campaign Against AfD Event\nNEVER MISS THE NEWS THAT MATTERS MOST\nZEROHEDGE DIRECTLY TO YOUR INBOX\n\nReceive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.\n\nSHOW COMMENTS"

They cut rates twice already. They’re going to go again whether its December [or] January,” the firm’s CEO and chief investment officer told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” this week. “Historically whenever the Fed cuts interest rates, usually that’s a turn of a new cycle. Market leadership does tend to change quietly.”\n\nHe lists the latest performance in areas ranging from emerging markets to industrials. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which tracks the group, is up 17% over the past six months as of Wednesday’s close. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund is up 9% over the same period.\n\n“I think they can be a good offset to what’s an expensive large cap tech position, which dominates most portfolios,” he added. “We’re living in a structurally higher inflation world. The Fed is cutting rates like, why do you want to take so much risk in just seven stocks?” and\n\nDavi prefers a global balanced approach to investing versus an overweight position in the Magnificent 7 — which is comprised of Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla and Alphabet, which has been trading around all-time highs. The Mag 7 makes up about a third of the S&P 500.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nSophia Massie, CEO of ETF-issuer LionShares, is also wary of going all-in on the AI trade.\n\n“I think analysts have an idea of how much value AI will add to our economy. I don’t think we really understand how that’s going to play out between different companies yet,” Massie said in the same interview. “So, I have this sense that right now, we’re pricing in this probability that... one company may be the one that dominates, dominates AI and ends up being a big player in the future.”\n\nDisclaimer"
